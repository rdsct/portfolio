                <p class="project_thales_context_paragraph">Thales Group is a French multinational company that designs
                    and builds
                    electrical systems and provides services for the aerospace, defence,
                    transportation and security markets. I was part of the railway division
                    of the company, and my department was responsible for implementing
                    the signaling and producing the necessary documentation to install and
                    maintain it.
                    The problem was that this process was long and tedious. In my team,
                    I helped in the complete full stack development of several Windows
                    applications that made life easier for my colleagues in this task. In this
                    instance, I will focus on one in particular, called Signal.
                    With this project, I want to demonstrate my skills to harmonize logic
                    and design; backend and frontend, given the resources and time I had
                    available. The final output was a fully functional Windows app.</p>

                <p>Signal was born as a response to a problem of the department, which needed an application to
                    manage the different types of signals that exist on the train tracks.
                    A Design-Thinking process was used to design, develop and implement every app, or improve the
                    already existing ones, being Signal a good example of its use.</p>

                    Interviews were perfomed in the context of user narration exercises. These exercises led to the
                    generation of
                    point of view sentences that materialized the needs and the reasons behind them. The how might we's
                    proposed solutions for these challenges.

                <h1>Mockups</h1>
                <p>I made several sketches of the UI after
                    getting an idea of how the application
                    logic would look like. It would have a main
                    window with the signals, and a series of
                    secondary tabs to view its components
                    (lamps, add-ons and systems).
                    In addition, each of these signals could be
                    edited in a modal pop-up window, which
                    could also be used to create new signals
                    or components of these signals.</p>

                <h1>User Flow Diagram</h1>
                <p>It was very important to make a user flow diagram
                    to be clear about the different functionalities of
                    the application and how they would be integrated
                    with the designed logic. The most important part
                    was to edit or query, depending on the type of
                    privileges available to the user in question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this case, the .NET and WPF made it very
                    easy to follow the diagram to the letter, giving the
                    possibility to integrate and reuse the different UI
                    modules in the windows.</p>

                <p>
                    As the application had to be developed full-stack, I also had a role in
                    developing the logic of it. Here, I show a brief diagram of how the logic was
                    implemented. I used the MVVM, or Model-View-ViewModel pattern as a
                    base for the program. I also show a brief model of the lamp class.</p>

                <h1>User testing</h1>
                <p>
                    User tests were performed with the first functional prototypes of the application. The simplicity
                    of the logic and the urgency of the application meant that functionality was superimposed
                    on the usability or good design of the application. After these tests, the application could be
                    refined to what it is today.</p>
                <p>
                    The tests consisted of asking users to perform a series of functions with the application. After
                    this, errors and suggestions were noted and the process was repeated several times.
                    Some of the many tasks and problems of the first iteration are shown here.</p>

                <p>
                    The final result was used by my colleagues and refined until it got
                    to what is shown here. I have decided to include this application as
                    a simple example of integration between user interface design and
                    logic, which can be applied in any other field of UI/UX.</p>
