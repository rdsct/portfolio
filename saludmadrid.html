                <p class="project_masterthesis_context_paragraph">Electrolux AB is a Swedish company that, among other
                    things,
                    manufactures household appliances. As a leading multinational brand in
                    several sectors, they are fully aware of the current problem regarding the
                    repair of such appliances. It is a tedious, complicated and even dangerous
                    process. I have developed my Master Thesis with the aim of designing the
                    perfect self-repair experience for hobs. However, it is only one example of
                    a repairable appliance that can be applied to any other product category.
                    One of the pillars of our project was the ability to diagnose any faults in
                    the hob by scanning an NFC tag that would open the official Electrolux
                    website or native app on our phone’s browser. Within that app, the user
                    could perform a series of actions to fix their appliance, upgrade it, or
                    simply consult relevant information about it.

                    In this project I intend to demonstrate my skills in human-centered and
                    user experience design, showing as a result a prototype app.</p>

            <section id="process">
                <h1>Process</h1>
                <p>We decided to follow a process model called Double Diamond. Here, the first diamond represents the
                    research phase, the second the design phase. We start with a problem statement to begin the research
                    (diverge) where we gather as much data as possible, to continue converging and start defining our
                    data. Then,
                    we revise this data, to then start with the design phase. We start diverging again, developing many
                    solutions,
                    to end up converging into a delivery, in which we choose among the different proposals. This an
                    iterative
                    process that can have many adjacent diamonds, depending on when we want to stop.</p>

                <p>Although this web application has not been fully developed (at least for the moment), since it is not
                    within the
                    scope of the Master Thesis, the logic of the system has been thought out. The reading of the NFC tag
                    by
                    the phone consists in the transmission of a text string which triggers the opening of the Electrolux
                    website
                    or app. In addition to this, a series of data is sent for the mobile phone to know what to do: what
                    is being
                    scanned, is it broken, what parts are inside?

                <h1>Product Autopsy</h1>
                <p>The product autopsy consists of the disassembly and analysis of the product to better understand its
                    parts,
                    how it works and have a starting point for its redesign. A visual analysis is perfomed to the
                    proceed to disassemble it.
                    It was investigated how each constituent part was made, who made it, what its specific purpose is
                    and how well it has
                    fulfilled its role in the overall function of the product.

                <h1>Mockups</h1>
                <p>A CJM (Customer Journey Map) was designed and perfected throughout the
                    various user tests to come up with the ultimate self-repair experience. Josefin
                    and me tried to use both physical whiteboards and the collaborative tool Miro to
                    synthesize our ideas.
                    During this process, I made a series of mockups that would serve as the skeleton
                    of the final app. It is worth mentioning that the design of the process and CJM
                    was parallel to the design of the glass ceramic itself, in what would be a physical
                    industrial design exercise.</p>

                <h1>Personas</h1>
                <p>Personas are fictional characters that are typically based on real-life observations of archetypal
                    users specific objectives and needs.
                    They represent groups of users within a targeted demographic who might use a particular product.
                    For this project, three different kinds of personas were identified based on their approach to
                    repair. The tinkerers are the most regular DIY-ers.
                    They are used to repairing stuff and they are not stressed by the situation.
                    The researchers have a more planned approach, and feel more stressed when something breaks,
                    and the helpless are unlikely to have carried out repairs themselves and are the most stressed.

                    The user flow diagram shows the path a user will take in an application to complete a task. In this
                    case the diagram starts with the scanning of the NFC tag in the hob
                    that triggers the opening of the app. It would continue with the main product view, with all the
                    relevant info about it, and if there's anything wrong an error message
                    would pop up. If the users decides to do something about it, it would show the instructions with the
                    steps to solve the issue. Similar steps would be used to replace a part
                    with the purpose of upgrading the hob even if it's not broken. The process is cyclical until the hob is working again.ll

                <p>
                    We conducted a series of user narration exercises with the first iteration of
                    the app and using the Figma prototyping tool to gather users’ insights and
                    comments about it, possible issues and to know which items needed to be
                    polished.</p>
                <p>
                    This exercise also helped us to improve our physical prototype, which
                    Josefin and me tested along with the app with 10 different users. We
                    tried to have a broad spectrum of technical and non-technical people, of
                    different ages, genders and education. If we could make it work for the most
                    helpless user, we could make it work for anybody.</p>

                    These exercises helped us to modify the application accordingly. This page shows the different
                    changes that were performed based on the feedback that we got. At this point, our idea was to design
                    a native app for Android and iOS, since Electrolux is interested in their users downloading and
                    using their app. However, using a universal kind of module like React Native would allow us to use
                    it both as a webapp and as a native app. Both versions can be seen in sketches and renders
                    indistinctly.</p>

                    This project is currently under development. With it I wanted to dig a
                    little deeper into the UX field and show the development of a mobile
                    application, to contrast a little with the previous, more technical
                    project developed for another platform. I also think it is especially
                    interesting to develop with cross-platform tools like React Native that
                    allow us to be flexible about the final destination of our research.</p>
